            VSync, what is it?
        </h2>
        <p>
            VSync, <strong>Vertical Sync</strong> or
            <strong>VSync technology</strong><em>,</em> is a graphics technology to make the image more fluid and to
            avoid screen tearing (left image) and stuttering (right image) by synchronising the frame rate of a game
            with a gaming monitor's refresh rate.

        <p>
            VSync allows the number of frames per second (FPS) to be limited so that the graphics card and the screen
            are synchronised on the rendering and display of the image.
        </p>
        <p>
            Desynchronisation can occur when the GPU provides more images than the monitor can display.
        </p>
        <p>
            A monitor is limited by its <strong>refresh rate</strong>. Should this rate be qual to 60Hz, the monitor
            will only be able to display 60 frames per second.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that Shadow can go to 144Hz as said in the <a
                href="https://help.shadow.tech/hc/en-gb/articles/360010753100">using automatic resolution and frame rate
                settings in Shadow</a>'s article. We would recommend to stick with 60Hz for resolution higher than 1920
            x 1080.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>G-Sync & Freesync, what's the difference?</h2>
        <p>
            G-Sync and Freesync are Nvidia and AMD's respective solutions to vertical synchronization.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Should we activate VSync on Shadow?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Short answer is <strong>no</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, Shadow already has a <strong>built-in anti-tearing solution</strong> in its firmware.
        </p>
        <p>
            Activating it would therefore be redundant and would not improve the quality of your image. It could
            actually lead to a loss of performance as resources would be used unnecessarily.
        </p>
